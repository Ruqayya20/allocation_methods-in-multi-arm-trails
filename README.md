This R is related is published on "A Comparison of Randomization Methods for Multi-Arm Clinical Trials" paper
This R code is to evaluate several randomisation procedures in the context of multi-arm clinical trials include: 
simple randomisation, permuted block randomisation, stratified randomisation with permuted blocks, urn design, block urn design, stratified block urn design, and minimisation. 
We evaluate properties such as group size balance, covariate balance, and the predictability of assignment. 
We also compare different definitions of statistical power relevant in multi-arm trials: marginal, disjunctive, and conjunctive powers.
